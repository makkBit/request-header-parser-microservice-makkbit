			li I can pass a string as a parameter, and it will check to see whether that string contains either a unix timestamp or a natural language date (example: January 1, 2016)
			li If it does, it returns both the Unix timestamp and the natural language form of that date.
			li If it does not contain a date or Unix timestamp, it returns null for those properties.

		h3 Example usage:
		p(class='well') 
			|https://timestamp-ms.herokuapp.com/December%2015,%202015<br>https://timestamp-ms.herokuapp.com/1450137600
		h3 Example output:
		p(class='well') 
			|{ "unix": 1450137600, "natural": "December 15, 2015" }
